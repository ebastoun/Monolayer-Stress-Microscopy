Description:
_____________
This piece of code computes internal stresses in cell monolayers (2-D)

Folder "Plane Stress" contains all the functions and scripts

- open the script called "main_script.m" and run the code block by block
  (WARNING: the name of the inputs must be updated, load your set of images)

- folder "outputs" contains all the outputs from the code. Some videos are also 
  generated in the folder "Plane Stress"

ADDITIONALLY (BASTOUNIS LABORATORY)
To compute MSM, the code needs the inputs from Traction Force Microscopy (TFM).
You will find an additional script called "TFM_calculation.m" to compute those. 
All the functions you need to run TFM_calculation.m are in another folder called
TFM_calculation.
