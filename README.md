Description:
_____________
This piece of code computes internal stresses in cell monolayers (2-D)

Folder "Plane Stress" contains all the functions and scripts

- open the script called "main_script.m" and run the code block by block
  (WARNING: the name of the inputs must be updated, load your set of TFM images)

- folder "outputs" contains all the outputs from the code. Some videos are also 
  generated in the folder "Plane Stress"
